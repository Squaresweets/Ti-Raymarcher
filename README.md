# Ti-Raymarcher
This is a raymarcher that just creates a render of a spinning cube on a TI calculator.

All tests have been done on a TI-84 plus silver edition

Everytime you want to render the next frame change line 10 from:
1→O
to:
9→O

This repository also contains the pre rendered pictures in .png and .8xi form as well as the final gif


Warning:

It takes a pretty long time to render
